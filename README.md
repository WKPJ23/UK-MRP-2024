# UK-MRP-2024
Utilizing an MRP model to predict constituencey-level outcomes for the UK 2024 Election.

We are leveraging a Multi-Level Regression with Post-Stratification (MRP) model to forecast constituency-level outcomes for the 2024 UK elections. MRP allows us to integrate individual-level survey data with constituency-level demographic and geographic information. By fitting a hierarchical regression model, we can estimate voting behaviour across different demographic groups and adjust these estimates according to the population structure of each constituency. This approach enhances the precision of our predictions, providing detailed insights into the likely election results across all UK constituencies.
